  "description": "Gathering for a tenth wedding anniversary party, the first guests to arrive, Ken and Chris Gorman, find the host of the evening lying in his upstairs bedroom bleeding from a gunshot wound and his wife is nowhere in sight. Though only a flesh wound, four couples are about to experience a severe attack of Farce. Ken, as the host’s lawyer, and Chris must get “the story” straight before the other guests arrive. As couples arrive, confusions and miscommunications mount and the evening spins off into classic farcical hilarity. Rumorsis full of non-stop silliness, intrigue, and hilarity that will have audiences on the edge of their seats. Rumorsis the perfect antidote to reality!"

### NUXT DEMO

This demonstrates how nuxt could be used to address server-side rendering for SEO

#### Running

* start the traditional web-api from the infinite repo
* in the web-portal directory of this repository run

```
npm install
npm run dev
```

* visit port 3333

#### What the demo shows

Not everything works in this demo, but:

* the list of tickets should load and render using the card component
* the top banner should render, mostly intact though the menu does not function
* clicking more info on an event should show an approximation of our event page that
  is adopted from the Nunjucks template. This page is rendered serverside but using vue.
  I did not attempt to duplicate all the metainfo tags, but some of them, title and description
  should be present and rendered serverside
